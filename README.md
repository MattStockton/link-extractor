link-extractor
==============

#### Overview
A python script to extract links from web pages. Give it a list of pages to extract from, and domains to look for, and it generates a csv result. I built this for a friend to be able to quickly find social links across many websites, and figured it might be useful for someone else too. 

#### Setup
Requires python and the packages listed in requirements.txt

#### How to Run
```sh
python link_extractor.py
```
This will show you what arguments you have to supply

#### Input Data
Look at sample_input.csv to see the required format for what sites to check, and what links / domains to check for.
